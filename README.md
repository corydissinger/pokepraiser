pokepraiser
===========

Project setup

- Change project.properties so that it points to the location of ActionBarSherlock on your machine

I have only used Eclipse to develop this app. You may need to include ActionBarSherlock as a project in the same workspace and update Pokepraiser's build path to include ActionBarSherlock if you wish to run/debug from eclipse.
